# Rapid-identification-and-quality-grading-of-Radix-Bupleuri
Original Data and Code for the Paper _Machine Learning-Assisted Raman Spectroscopy for Rapid Classification and Regression Prediction of Radix Bupleuri_
Taking Bupleuri Radix as an example, a research method integrating machine learning and chemical analysis has been developed for rapid identification of types and origins, as well as quality grading, of Chinese herbal materials.
